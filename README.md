Covid 19 Cases Data Visualization 

This project presents a series of visualizations to explore COVID-19 case trends using both Matplotlib and Plotly:

- Daily COVID-19 Cases Scatter Plot (Matplotlib): Highlights daily case fluctuations with a clear view of spikes and trends over time.
- Total Cases Bar Chart (Matplotlib): Summarizes the overall number of cases to compare total impact across categories (e.g., countries, regions).
- Interactive Case Trends Over Time (Plotly): A dynamic line chart showing how COVID-19 cases evolved across different years.
- Interactive Country Comparison Bar Chart (Plotly): Enables user interaction to compare total COVID-19 cases across countries with hover and zoom functionality.
These visualizations help uncover key insights into the progression and global distribution of COVID-19.
